# Assignment 2 for Operating System Principles

To run this this program on the RMIT servers first download and extract the zip folder on to a desired location. Then on the RMIT servers follow the following steps:

- First navigate into the folder called `a2`
- Then enable the dev toolkit using the following command `scl enable devtoolset-11 bash`

Once those steps are done then we can build the project and run the different commands.

## Running the project

### Compiling

The project can run 3 different scheduling algorithms `fifo`, `sjf`, and `rr`. To make a specific project run the command

- `make  <algorithm name>`

However if you choose to make all the projects at one you can simply run the command

- `make` OR `make all`

### Run Command

To run the project once everything has been compiled, one of three algorithms can be run. Each of these have their individual commands which are as follows:

#### First in First Out (FIFO)

To run fifo, the following command needs to be run

- `./fifo <datafile>`

`<datafile>` should be replaced with the name of the file that is going to be read in.

#### Shortest Job First (SJF)

To run sjf, the following command needs to be run

- `./sjf <datafile>`

`<datafile>` should be replaced with the name of the file that is going to be read in.

#### Round Robin (RR)

To run rr, the following command needs to be run

- `./rr <quantum> <datafile>`

`<datafile>` should be replaced with the name of the file that is going to be read in.

`<quantum>` should be replaced with an integer value
